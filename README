rdiff-backup-web was previously maintained on [SF](http://rdiffbackupweb.sourceforge.net) and I have neglected it as a project for to long. 

With the move to Github a large amount of change is about to happen so please look to the [issues](https://github.com/puredistortion/rdiff-backup-web/issues) page for this project to see where rdiff web is moving to, and have your say on the direction of this project.

The prevoius PHP incarnation of rdoff-backup-web will continue to exist and I will fix issues as they are raised for the short to medium term.

As always feel free to email rdiffbackupweb [at] puredistortion [dot] com with any feedback or issues, but it would save time if you just added a github issue to the project as it will just end up there :)
